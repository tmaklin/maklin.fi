## About me
I'm a researcher at the [University of
Oslo](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/?vrtx=person-view&uid=tommiem)
working in the intersection of bacterial (meta)genomics, probabilistic
modelling, and bioinformatics software development. My research currently
focuses on the ecology, evolution, and epidemiology of bacterial species that are
implicated in development of [colorectal and urinary tract cancers](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00283-0/fulltext).

Hi, my name is Tommi M&auml;klin.

## About me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of
Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/people/people-finder/tommi-maklin-9362251). I
work in the intersection of bacterial (meta)genomics, probabilistic
modelling, and bioinformatics software development. My research
focuses on common human pathogens that are deemed high-risk due to
[antimicrobial
resistance](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed)
and I typically work with clinical datasets from European countries.

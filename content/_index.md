Hi, my name is Tommi M&auml;klin.

## About me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of
Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/people/people-finder/tommi-maklin-9362251),
currently visiting the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling
group](https://www.bacpop.org/) at the EMBL-EBI. I work in the
intersection of bacterial (meta)genomics, probabilistic modelling, and
bioinformatics software development. My research focuses on common
human pathogens that are deemed high-risk due to [antimicrobial
resistance](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed).

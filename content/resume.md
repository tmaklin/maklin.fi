### Profile {#profile}
I’m a researcher specializing in computational biology and bioinformatics, with
a focus on how microbes influence human health. I develop and apply statistical
and algorithmic methods to analyze gut microbiome data, and have worked on
multiple open-source tools that help scientists track bacterial pathogens, study
the microbiome, and understand how bacteria influence diseases such as cancer.

My background spans academic research, entrepreneurship, and the trade union
movement, including organizing large-scale events and being elected to the board
of the Finnish union of university researchers and teachers. I’m interested
advocating for better working conditions in academia and turning complex data
into results with translational potential and bridging the gap between research
and real-world impact.

### Skills {#skills}
* Creative problem solving
  : Skilled in identifying data-driven solutions quickly and developing them
    into finished products. My research profile demonstrates this with a range
    of innovative technical advances and ground-breaking work in applying them
    to real-world problems.

* Data presentation and communication
  : Experience in presenting and publishing research results in international
    venues and in communicating data driven action points. In addition to my
    scientific work, I have authored data based strategy documents, statements,
    and recommendations for a trade unions.

* Project management
  : Proven ability to plan and execute research and software development
    projects, both in teams and independently. My management experience also
    consists of leadership roles in research projects, event organization, and
    in labour rights advocacy.

### Experience {#experience}

University of Oslo
: *Researcher*  
  __2025--ongoing__  
: I am currently focusing on the ecology, evolution, and epidemiology of
bacterial species that are associated with the development of several cancer
types. My work is based on analyzing microbiome data to understand how these
bacteria contribute to cancer development and how significant their impact is
for the individual.
<br>

University of Helsinki
: *Postdoctoral researcher*  
  __2023--2024__  
: I developed highly scalable softwarefor microbial genomics, which enabled
comparative studies of gut microbiome diversity between high and low-to-middle
income countries. Our results culminated in a research paper linking diversity
in the gut microbiome to differences in population-level incidence of colorectal
cancer.
<br>

Helsinki Institute for Information Technology
: *Doctoral researcher*  
  __2018--2022__  
: My PhD focused on statistical modelling of microbiome data from pathogenic
bacteria. I produced software tools for accurately identifying the bacteria in a
sample and pioneered more efficient genomic epidemiological analyses from
metagenomics data, which have since been widely adopted by others in the field.
<br>

Heldata oy
: *Part-time entrepreneur*  
  __2018--2022__  
: I was involved in organizing an annual Data Science networking event in
Helsinki. My responsibilities were day-to-day operation of the company, event
planning and management, and aiding sales & marketing. With around 500
participants in 2019, Data Science Day was the largest data
science recruiting event in Finland.
<br>

Stokastiko oy
: *Independent consultant*  
  __2016--2018__  
: I consulted organizations in statistics, data analysis and web services. This
  included a 3-day course into statistics, maintaining static websites for a
  nonprofit organization, and statistical analyses.

### Volunteer experience
Vice chair
: *Helsinki University Association of Researchers and Teachers*  
 __2020--2025__  
: During my terms, I worked on making the union more proactive, on member
recruitment, and on increasing our influence to a level more proportional to our
size. I also took extra responsibility in management of the union, and wrote several
statements, opinion pieces, and strategy documents that influenced its
direction.
<br>

Board member
: *Finnish Union of University Researchers and Teachers*  
 __2023--2025__  
: I was involved in planning the union's strategy and key focus areas, primarily
focusing on bringing labour rights to the forefront of the union's activities. I
also had an active role in the group preparing goals and strategy for
the 2025 wage negotiations round, and in the recruitment of a new
executive officer in 2024.
